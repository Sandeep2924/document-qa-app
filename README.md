# Document QA App

A full-stack web application that allows users to upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT), processes them on the backend using FastAPI and LangChain, and enables question-answering on the document content.

---

## Features

- Upload multiple document types (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`)
- Backend document processing with LangChain and OpenAI API
- Responsive frontend built with React and Chakra UI
- Real-time toast notifications for upload status
- Easy-to-extend architecture for adding new document loaders or AI models

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI, LangChain, OpenAI API, Uvicorn
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Chakra UI, Axios, Vite
- **Others:** Python 3.10+, Node.js, npm/yarn

---

## Setup and Installation

### Backend

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"  # macOS/Linux
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key       # Windows (cmd)
```

4. Run the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

---

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

---

## Usage

1. Open the frontend app in your browser (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
2. Upload your document using the file picker.
3. The app will process the document on the backend and provide relevant answers to your queries.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **`ModuleNotFoundError` for `langchain_community`**
  Run `pip install -U langchain-community`

* **`uvicorn` command not found**
  Use `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload` or install uvicorn inside your virtual environment

* **Frontend import errors with Chakra UI**
  Ensure you have the correct version installed and your dependencies are up to date.
